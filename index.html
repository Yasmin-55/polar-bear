  <P style="border:1px solid black;" font weight="bold" margin="10px" > Polar bear mothers give birth to one to three cubs, usually in a snow den during winter. The mother stays with her cubs in the den for a few months, keeping them warm and feeding them. After they leave the den, the mother teaches the cubs how to hunt and survive in the wild. The cubs stay with their mother for about two and a half years before living on their own.
